.. warning::
    Open-TYNDP is under active development and is not yet feature-complete. The current `development status <https://open-tyndp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#development-status>`__ and the general `Limitations <https://open-tyndp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/limitations.html>`__ are important to understand before using the model.

This repository introduces the open model dataset of the Open-TYNDP research and innovation project, which is a collaboration between `Open Energy Transition (OET) <https://openenergytransition.org/>`__ and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E). The project’s aim is to explore and consider the adoption of PyPSA in the Ten-Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP) by building a workflow based on `PyPSA-Eur <https://github.com/pypsa/pypsa-eur>`__. It seeks to complement the tools currently used in the TYNDP cycles, especially for Scenario Building (SB) and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA). This approach is designed to enhance transparency and lower barriers to stakeholder participation in European energy planning. Beyond Europe, the project aspires to demonstrate the viability of open-source (OS) frameworks in energy planning, encouraging broader global adoption.

To build trust in and ensure reproducibility with the new open-source toolchain, the project first focuses on replicating key figures from the 2024 TYNDP cycle, before aligning with the current 2026 TYNDP cycle. This process involves developing new features within the open-source domain to address existing gaps, integrating tools for data interoperability and dynamic visualizations, and publishing best practices to encourage the adoption of open energy models. Additionally, the project emphasizes stakeholder consultations and `interactive workshops <https://open-energy-transition.github.io/open-tyndp-workshops/intro.html>`__ alongside the development of the PyPSA tool, further promoting collaboration and transparency throughout the process.

This repository is a soft-fork of `OET/PyPSA-Eur <https://github.com/open-energy-transition/pypsa-eur>`__ and contains the entire project `Open-TYNDP` supported by OET, including code and documentation. The philosophy behind this repository is that no intermediary results are included, but all results are computed from raw data and code.

This repository is maintained using `OET's soft-fork strategy <https://open-energy-transition.github.io/handbook/docs/Engineering/SoftForkStrategy>`__. OET's primary aim is to contribute as much as possible to the open-source (OS) upstream repositories. For long-term changes that cannot be directly merged upstream, the strategy organizes and maintains OET forks, ensuring they remain up-to-date and compatible with upstream on a regular basis, while also supporting future contributions back to the OS repositories.

|

Open-Source ecosystem
==================

The Open-TYNDP repository builds on the open-source ecosystem of `PyPSA <https://github.com/pypsa/pypsa>`__ and `PyPSA-Eur <https://github.com/pypsa/pypsa-eur>`__ which are developed and maintained by several organizations, including `Open Energy Transition (OET) <https://openenergytransition.org/>`__, `Technische Universität Berlin (TUB) <https://www.tu.berlin/en/ensys/>`__, `Fraunhofer <https://www.fraunhofer.de/>`__, `Ostbayerische Technische Hochschule (OTH) <https://www.oth-regensburg.de/en/>`__, `Universita di Pisa (UNIPI) <https://www.unipi.it/en/>`__ and `Danmarks Tekniske Universitet (DTU) <https://www.dtu.dk/english/>`__. This group of maintainers consists of individuals who have significantly contributed to the projects over time and earned the authority to review and accept change requests. This privilege comes with the responsibility to continuously work on the repository and contribute to enhancements, stability, security and more. This worldwide ecosystem involves energy researchers, system operators, regulators, NGOs, and policymakers.

.. image:: img/tyndp/open-source-ecosystem.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Open-Source Ecosystem

Within this ecosystem, independent organisations can develop their own private repositories using the publicly available Open-TYNDP and PyPSA-Eur codebases. This shared foundation ensures interoperability and creates opportunities for partnership through sharing and co-developing features. By using a soft-fork strategy, each private repository can contribute to and benefit from the shared research and development environment. The shared foundation also enables organisations to request support and feature development from other actors.

Each organisation in this open-source ecosystem remains fully independent of the shared foundation, maintaining its own governance structure and decision-making processes regarding its codebase. Organisations are also free to keep parts of their code private.

Development status
==================

.. warning::
    Open-TYNDP is under active development and is not yet feature-complete. The current development status and general :doc:`limitations` are important to understand before using the model. The model includes partial data from the TYNDP 2024 cycle, and its validation is ongoing. The github repository `issues <https://github.com/open-energy-transition/open-tyndp/issues>`__ collects known topics we are working on (please feel free to help or make suggestions). The fact that this project relies on a soft-fork strategy implies that `upstream issues <https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA-Eur/issues>`__ need to be addressed in the PyPSA-Eur repository. This `documentation <https://open-tyndp.readthedocs.io/>`__ also remains work in progress.

Already implemented features
-------------------------------

The back-casting of the 2024 TYNDP cycle involves developing new features based on the published `modelling methodology report <https://2024.entsos-tyndp-scenarios.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TYNDP_2024_Scenarios_Methodology_Report_Final_Version_250128.pdf>`__. Major and already implemented features are summarized below. Please, refer to the :doc:`release_notes` for a more comprehensive list of features and to the relevant `pull requests <https://github.com/open-energy-transition/open-tyndp/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3A%22major+feature%22>`__ for extensive documentation of the implementations.

Background on PyPSA-Eur
=========

Electricity System
------------------

The electricity system representation contains alternating current lines at
and above 220 kV voltage level and all high voltage direct current lines,
substations, an open database of conventional power plants, time series for
electrical demand and variable renewable generator availability, geographic
potentials for the expansion of wind and solar power.

The model is suitable both for operational studies and generation and
transmission expansion planning studies. The continental scope and highly
resolved spatial scale enables a proper description of the long-range smoothing
effects for renewable power generation and their varying resource availability.

Sector-Coupled Energy System
----------------------------

A sector-coupled extension (previously known as **PyPSA-Eur-Sec**, which is now
deprecated) adds demand and supply for the following sectors: transport, space
and water heating, biomass, energy consumption in the agriculture, industry and
industrial feedstocks, carbon management, carbon capture and
usage/sequestration. This completes the energy system and includes all
greenhouse gas emitters except waste management, agriculture, forestry and land
use. The diagram below gives an overview of the sectors and the links between
them:

.. image:: img/multisector_figure.png
    :width: 70%
    :align: center

.. note::
    You can find showcases of the model's capabilities in the Supplementary Materials of the
    Joule paper `The potential role of a hydrogen network in Europe
    <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2023.06.016>`__, the Supplementary Materials of another `paper in Joule with a
    description of the industry sector
    <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2022.04.016>`__, or in `a 2021 presentation
    at EMP-E <https://nworbmot.org/energy/brown-empe.pdf>`__.
    The sector-coupled extension of PyPSA-Eur was
    initially described in the paper `Synergies of sector coupling and transmission
    reinforcement in a cost-optimised, highly renewable European energy system
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05290>`__ (2018) but it differs by being based on the
    higher resolution electricity transmission model `PyPSA-Eur
    <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur>`__ rather than a one-node-per-country model,
    and by including biomass, industry, industrial feedstocks, aviation, shipping,
    better carbon management, carbon capture and usage/sequestration, and gas
    networks.

About
-----

PyPSA-Eur is designed to be imported into the open energy system modelling
framework `PyPSA <https://www.pypsa.org>`__ for which `documentation
<https://pypsa.readthedocs.io>`__ is available as well. However, since the
workflow is modular, it should be easy to adapt the data workflow to other
modelling frameworks.

The restriction to freely available and open data encourages the open exchange
of model data developments and eases the comparison of model results. It
provides a full, automated software pipeline to assemble the load-flow-ready
model from the original datasets, which enables easy replacement and improvement
of the individual parts.

.. warning::
    PyPSA-Eur is under active development and has several
    :doc:`limitations` which
    you should understand before using the model. The Github repository
    `issues <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/issues>`__ collect known
    topics we are working on. Please feel free to help or make suggestions.

This project is currently maintained by the `Department of Digital
Transformation in Energy Systems <https://www.tu.berlin/en/ensys>`__ at the
`Technische Universität Berlin <https://www.tu.berlin>`__. Previous versions were
developed within the `IAI <http://www.iai.kit.edu>`__ at the `Karlsruhe Institute
of Technology (KIT) <http://www.kit.edu/english/index.php>`__ which was funded by
the `Helmholtz Association <https://www.helmholtz.de/en/>`__, and by the
`Renewable Energy Group
<https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/physics/schramm/renewable-energy-system-and-network-analysis/>`__
at `FIAS <https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/>`__ to carry out simulations for the
`CoNDyNet project <http://condynet.de/>`__, financed by the `German Federal
Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) <https://www.bmbf.de/en/index.html>`__
as part of the `Stromnetze Research Initiative
<http://forschung-stromnetze.info/projekte/grundlagen-und-konzepte-fuer-effiziente-dezentrale-stromnetze/>`__.
