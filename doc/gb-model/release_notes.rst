Release Notes
##########################################

Unreleased
==========

* Add HiGHS HiPO solver to `pixi` dependencies and to the solver config options.
* Fix demand profile scaling to correctly match annual FES demands.
  This increases heat, EV, and baseline electricity demand in all model regions (GB & EUR) compared to the previous version.
* Move resistive heating demand to the heat demand bus, rather than having it rolled in with baseline electricity demand.
* Fix total electricity demand in GB to match the total demand given in the FES by filling the difference with a constant baseload demand and a variable T&D loss profile (matching the profile shape of all other demands combined).
  This increases total GB demand compared to the previous version.
* Get electrolysis efficiency directly from comparison of flows in and out of networked electrolysis defined in the FES workbook.
  This increases electrolysis efficiency compared to the previous version.
* Update source of hydrogen demand to use networked electrolysis hydrogen demand directly, rather than the leftover hydrogen demand after considering all other sources of hydrogen supply (e.g. blue H2).
  This increases GB hydrogen demand compared to the previous version.
* Fix technology efficiencies being erroneously set to 100% in network composition.

v0.2.2 (2026-03-24)
===================

This is a minor release that mostly includes workflow fixes and improved configuration validation.

This version was synchronised with the upstream PyPSA-Eur repository on 2026-03-19.

* Fix missing lines in boundary crossings by using extended PyPSA base network for crossing identification.
* Add option to scale boundary capabilities to reflect seasonal variations (#267).
* Add option to subset FES scenarios to run.
* Add FAQs to the docs (#221).
* Update all dependencies defined in `pixi.lock` without changing version pinning in `pixi.toml`.
* Switch off optimisation "noisy costs" to avoid large negative contributions to the objective function value from bidirectional links.
* Account for snapshot weighting and in redispatch version of the storage unit energy balance constraint.
* Add data cleaning section into the docs, to describe some of our data processing steps in more detail.
* Automate custom busmaps for correctly connecting offshore wind farm buses with their appropriate onshore regions.
* Correctly align line/link flow directions when applying the boundary constraints (#259).
* Use historical gas prices to compute bid/offer multipliers (#257).
* Fix unexpected connection between two GB regions caused by a new offshore virtual bus that was not accounted for in `data/gb-model/custom_busmap/*.csv` (#258).

v0.2.1 (2026-03-05)
===================

This is a minor release that mostly includes workflow fixes and improved configuration validation.

This version was synchronised with the upstream PyPSA-Eur repository on 2026-02-26.

* Create GSP shapefile using GSP polygon, coordinate and FES workbook data (#251).
* Disallow nuclear from being redispatched (#201).

* Automate ETYS boundary line/link crossings.
* Update config filenames. `config/config.gb.2024.yaml` defines the FES2024 configuration; `config/config.default.gb.yaml` is automatically generated and should not be edited directly (#235).
* Add config validation and associated documentation for the additional configuration required for the gb-dispatch-model (#235).
* Switch regions `GB 30` and `GB 31` and rename new `GB 31` to `GB NI` to more explicitly represent the Northern Ireland region.
* Set line capacities to large number for constrained network to make sure only boundary capabilities are limiting (#241).
* New config option to enable aggregating the PyPSA network time dimensions, to reduce solve times (#229).
* Created new OSM pre-built network, available at https://zenodo.org/records/18712831, to include updates made in upstream PyPSA-Eur (incl. ignoring unbuilt lines) (#237).
* Fix reaching Elexon API request limit when running snakemake with multiple cores by forcing all cores to be used for the data fetching rule.
* Adding `async` for API request that fetches the mapping of Elexon BMU units to a fueltype (#225).
* Allow for boundary capabilities to increase in line with outputs from an ETYS report + from manual additions (configurable, defaults to True) (#219, #239).
* Account for time aggregation in the nuclear annual operation custom constraints (#233)

v0.2.0 (2026-02-13)
===================

This release of the GB dispatch model is configured for use with FES2024 data.
Due to the differences in data structure compared to FES2021, it is not possible to use this version for FES years prior to 2023.
Instead, development for <= FES2022 should branch off from v0.1.0.

This version was synchronised with the upstream PyPSA-Eur repository on 2026-02-10.

* Publish documentation on readthedocs.org.
* Calculate bid/offer multipliers using data from Elexon (#161, #209).
* Add BritNed as an existing interconnector in default config (#210).
* Use correct currency (GBP, not EUR) in docs.
* Clean SPDX copyright text where an outdated repository name was being used.
* Add docs page detailing our dispatch/redispatch methodology (#158).
* Update custom busmap definition to have one per configured run name (``data/gb-model/custom-busmap.csv`` -> ``data/gb-model/custom-busmap/<run-name>.csv``) (#207).
* Extend workflow to run all FES scenarios in parallel (#215).
* Fix monthly outage calculations by using the `entsoe-py` package to collect outages and DUKES data to define current capacities (#204).
* Impose nuclear capacity factor range to enforce nuclear power plant usage where it would otherwise have unrealistically low generation / high dispatchability (#201 and #202).
* Fix storage flows in redispatch (both for the original asset and the ramp up/down assets) (#196).
* Use `Generator` component for all ramp up/down assets to simplify optimisation problem.
* Update to FES2024, with the side effect of fixing load shedding issues (#163, #155, #156).

v0.1.0 (2026-01-23)
