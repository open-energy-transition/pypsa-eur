The first part can be ``v`` (for setting a limit on line volume) or ``c`` (for setting a limit on line cost). The second part can be ``opt`` or a float bigger than one (e.g. 1.25). If ``opt`` is chosen line expansion is optimised according to its capital cost (where the choice ``v`` only considers overhead costs for HVDC transmission lines, while ``c`` uses more accurate costs distinguishing between overhead and underwater sections and including inverter pairs). The setting ``v1.25`` will limit the total volume of line expansion to 25% of currently installed capacities weighted by individual line lengths. The setting ``c1.25`` will allow to build a transmission network that costs no more than 25 % more than the current system."
