# Open-TYNDP: Interfacing Open Energy System Planning with ENTSO-E Models and Contributing to TYNDP
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-energy-transition/oet-website/main/assets/img/oet-logo-red-n-subtitle.png" alt="Open Energy Transition Logo" width="260" height="100" align="right">

> [!WARNING]
> Open-TYNDP is under active development and is not yet feature-complete. The current [development status](#development-status) and the general [Limitations](https://open-tyndp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/limitations.html) are important to understand before using the model.

This repository introduces the open model dataset of the Open-TYNDP research and innovation project, which is a collaboration between [Open Energy Transition (OET)](https://openenergytransition.org/) and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E). The project’s aim is to explore and consider the adoption of PyPSA in the Ten-Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP) by building a workflow based on [PyPSA-Eur](https://github.com/pypsa/pypsa-eur). It seeks to complement the tools currently used in the TYNDP cycles, especially for Scenario Building (SB) and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA). This approach is designed to enhance transparency and lower barriers to stakeholder participation in European energy planning. Beyond Europe, the project aspires to demonstrate the viability of open-source (OS) frameworks in energy planning, encouraging broader global adoption.

To build trust in and ensure reproducibility with the new open-source toolchain, the project first focuses on replicating key figures from the 2024 TYNDP cycle, before aligning with the current 2026 TYNDP cycle. This process involves developing new features within the open-source domain to address existing gaps, integrating tools for data interoperability and dynamic visualizations, and publishing best practices to encourage the adoption of open energy models. Additionally, the project emphasizes stakeholder consultations and [interactive workshops](https://open-energy-transition.github.io/open-tyndp-workshops/intro.html) alongside the development of the PyPSA tool, further promoting collaboration and transparency throughout the process.

This repository is a soft-fork of [OET/PyPSA-Eur](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/pypsa-eur) and contains the entire project `Open-TYNDP` supported by OET, including code and documentation. The philosophy behind this repository is that no intermediary results are included, but all results are computed from raw data and code.

This repository is maintained using [OET's soft-fork strategy](https://open-energy-transition.github.io/handbook/docs/Engineering/SoftForkStrategy). OET's primary aim is to contribute as much as possible to the open-source upstream repositories. For long-term changes that cannot be directly merged upstream, the strategy organizes and maintains OET forks, ensuring they remain up-to-date and compatible with upstream on a regular basis, while also supporting future contributions back to the OS repositories.

# Development status

**Warning**: Open-TYNDP is under active development and is not yet feature-complete. The current development status and general [Limitations](https://open-tyndp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/limitations.html) are important to understand before using the model. The model includes partial data from the TYNDP 2024 cycle, and its validation is ongoing. The github repository [issues](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/open-tyndp/issues) collect known topics we are working on (please feel free to help or make suggestions). The fact that this project relies on a soft-fork strategy implies that [upstream issues](https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA-Eur/issues) need to be addressed in the PyPSA-Eur repository. The [documentation](https://open-tyndp.readthedocs.io/) also remains work in progress.

## ✅ Already implemented features

The back-casting of the 2024 TYNDP cycle involves developing new features based on the published [modelling methodology report](https://2024.entsos-tyndp-scenarios.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TYNDP_2024_Scenarios_Methodology_Report_Final_Version_250128.pdf). Major and already implemented features are summarized below. Please, refer to the [Release Notes](https://open-tyndp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release_notes.html) for a more comprehensive list of features and to the relevant [pull requests](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/open-tyndp/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3A%22major+feature%22) for extensive documentation of the implementations.

# Repository structure

* `benchmarks`: will store `snakemake` benchmarks (does not exist initially)
* `config`: configurations used in the study
* `cutouts`: will store raw weather data cutouts from `atlite` (does not exist initially)
* `data`: includes input data that is not produced by any `snakemake` rule
* `doc`: includes all files necessary to build the `readthedocs` documentation of PyPSA-Eur
* `envs`: includes backup `conda` environments if `pixi` installation does not work.
* `logs`: will store log files (does not exist initially)
* `notebooks`: includes all the `notebooks` used for ad-hoc analysis
* `report`: contains all files necessary to build the report; plots and result files are generated automatically
* `rules`: includes all the `snakemake`rules loaded in the `Snakefile`
* `resources`: will store intermediate results of the workflow which can be picked up again by subsequent rules (does not exist initially)
* `results`: will store the solved PyPSA network data, summary files and plots (does not exist initially)
* `scripts`: includes all the Python scripts executed by the `snakemake` rules to build the model

# Installation and Usage

## 1. Installation

### Option A: Windows Installer (Recommended for Windows)

For Windows users, download the latest installer (e.g., `open-tyndp-0.4.0-pixi-Windows-x86_64.exe`) from the [releases page](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/open-tyndp/releases) and run it. The installer automatically sets up everything you need, including pixi, the repository, and the conda environment. See `utils/windows-installer/README.md` for details.

### Option B: Manual Installation (All Platforms)

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/open-energy-transition/open-tyndp
```
PyPSA-Eur, and consequently Open-TYNDP, relies on a set of other Python packages to function.
We manage these using [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/>).
Once pixi is installed, you can activate the project environment for your operating system and have access to all the PyPSA-Eur dependencies from the command line:

```sh
pixi shell -e open-tyndp
```

>[!NOTE]
>`pixi` will create a distinct environment in every project directory, even if you have identical copies of a project cloned locally.
>As there is a common system-level package cache, `pixi` efficiently conserves disk space in such cases.

>[!TIP]
>If `pixi` isn't working, you can install from one of the fallback `conda` environment files found in `envs`.
>For more details see [the PyPSA-Eur installation guide](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## 2. Run the analysis

```sh
pixi run tyndp
```

This will run all analysis steps to reproduce results and build the report.

To list all the rules that need to be executed (dry run), run:

```sh
pixi run tyndp -n
```

Note: The workflow automatically generates dependency graphs after successful completion (via `rulegraphs` and `filegraphs` rules). The generated graphs are saved to the `resources/` directory.
